<li><h4> PAYMENTS</h4>
<br>
PDF Drive may provide users with free and paid services. Payments can be made on a one-time or regular basis depending on tariffs, selected by the user.
<br><br>
You may cancel your membership at anytime, and cancellations will be effective immediately. You will lose any remaining downloads or access. We do not provide refunds or credits for any partial membership period.
<br><br>
PDF Drive will begin billing your payment method for regular subscription fees corresponding to your subscription plan plus any applicable tax. To view the specific details of your subscription plan, log on at https://www.pdfdrive.com/auth/login and click “Account Settings” once you are logged on to the PDF Drive website. We will continue to bill your payment method on a regular basis for your membership plan until you cancel. You may cancel your membership at anytime. We offer a number of subscription plans. We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered plans or to decease the downloads per month to which you are entitled under a particular plan. Unless otherwise stated differently, your “Billing Cycle” refers respectively to subscription that you chose upon registration.
<br><br>
By starting your PDF Drive membership, you are expressly agreeing that we are authorized to charge you a membership fee for your Billing Cycle, any applicable tax and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the PDF Drive Services to the payment method you provided during registration (or to a different payment method if you change your account information). As used in these Terms of Use, "billing" shall indicate either a charge or debit, as applicable, against your payment method, where applicable. The membership fee will be billed at the beginning of your membership and on each renewal thereafter unless and until you cancel your membership if regular subscription was chosen. For example, if you became a paying member on January 31st and you chose monthly payment, your payment method would next be billed on February 28th. We may also periodically authorize your card in anticipation of membership. All fees and charges are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. We may change the fees and charges in effect, or add new fees and charges from time to time, but we will give you advance notice of these changes by email or prominently at the PDF Drive website. If you want to use a different Payment Method please contact PDF Drive support by visiting https://www.pdfdrive.com/ and clicking on “Contact. If your Payment Method reaches its expiration date, your continued use of the service beyond that date constitutes your authorization for us to continue billing that Payment Method and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. Your PDF Drive membership will continue in effect unless and until you cancel your membership or we terminate it. You must cancel your membership at least one day before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next monthly, biannual or annual membership fees to your Payment Method.

<br><br>
This policy may be revised over time as new features are added to the Site or as we incorporate suggestions from our users. If we are going to use or disclose your personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time we collected the information, you will have a choice as to whether or not we use or disclose your information in this new manner. We will also post a notification that the Privacy Policy has been amended prominently on our Web site so that you can always review what information we gather, how we might use that information, and under which conditions we will disclose it to anyone.
<br><br>
We use contact information i.e. your email address to help us efficiently perform account tasks (changing passwords, retrieving lost passwords), to deliver the services you have requested, to perform quality assurance, sales analyses and other business analyses, and to contact you in connection with any orders that you have placed with us. No other use of your financial information will be made except to satisfy any law, regulation, governmental request, or judicial order. When you make a purchase through the Site, or register with the Site, you will provide us with an email address where we, or these service providers, may contact you for the purposes described in this paragraph.

<br><br>
PDF Drive may use your demographic information to perform business analyses or to tailor the Site and communications to your interests. We may share anonymous, aggregated demographic information with advertisers and other third parties so that they can tailor their advertisements and communications to the appropriate audience. Any time that we are allowed under this privacy policy to share your contact information or financial information, we may also share your demographic information along with it.
<br><br>
PDF Drive may disclose specific contact information when we determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with law, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of PDF Drive or other visitors to the site or users of the Services. Also, your contact information may be passed on to a third party in the event of a merger, acquisition, consolidation, divestiture, or a bankruptcy of PDF Drive.
<br><br>
Cookies : A "cookie" is a small file that we save on your computer's hard drive that contains non-personal information. These cookies help to give you faster access to pages you have already visited. They also allow you to personalize your pages, and optimize your experience at our sites. We also use cookies to help us figure out how many people visit our sites, which of our web pages they visit, and how long they stay there. This information helps us figure out which of our web features are highly successful and which sites might need improvement. You can disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but allow you to disable them. Disabling cookies may prevent you from properly using the Services or accessing the site.
<br><br>
Sessions : "Session IDs" allow us to identify a particular user across multiple web page requests. This Session ID is maintained within your cookie file, where possible. If cookies are not enabled, or if the user's internet browser program does not support cookies then PDF Drive will place the Session ID in the requested web page. This allows the end user to avoid having to continually re-enter certain information such as account name and password for every web page request. This Session ID expires whenever the user closes their internet browser.
<br><br>
Tracking : Many of our web pages also contain special electronic images (called a "single-pixel gif" or "gifs") that allow us to gather only non-personally identifiable traffic statistics and other aggregate information about visitors to our sites. PDF Drive (through itself or third parties) uses this technology to collect and accumulate anonymous data that helps us understand and analyze the experience of people visiting our web sites and, along with other information you provide, customize your future visits and improve our web sites. For example, we capture data on the type of browser used, operating system software (e.g. Windows 95 vs. 98 or Macintosh), cookie preferences (whether the user has them turned on or off), and search engine keywords (what key words did a visitor use to get to our site). We also record number of visits, paths taken, and time spent on sites and pages within PDF Drive's web sites. Please keep in mind that none of this information is personally identifiable and that we only distribute this information to internal staff at PDF Drive and to partners that have signed confidentiality agreements with us. Any information that we do share with partners reflects overall web site or Internet usage trends, not individual.
<br><br>
IP Address : Each time you visit the Site, we automatically collect your IP address and the web page from which you came. In order to administer and optimize the Site for you and to diagnose problems with our Site, we use your IP address to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you. We also use your IP address to restrict the access of your account to broader users.
<br><br>
Storage : You understand and agree that PDF Drive stores and processes your information on computers located in Germany, and by providing any data to PDF Drive, you consent to the transfer of such information to Germany. When you a delete a file from your PDF Drive account, no link will remain between you and that file. Deleted files may stay cached in PDF Drive servers to save bandwidth in case other people request them.</li>
